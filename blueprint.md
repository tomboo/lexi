# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple turn-based chatbot web application to interact with a cloud database and an LLM. The application will allow users to have conversations with an AI assistant.

## Implemented Features

*   **Chat Interface:** A visually appealing and user-friendly chat interface.
*   **Message Display:** A component to display user and AI messages in a conversational format.
*   **User Input:** A text input field and a "Send" button for users to interact with the chatbot.
*   **Styling:** A modern design using Material-UI, including a color palette, custom components, and a responsive layout.
*   **Routing:** Basic routing implemented using `react-router-dom`.

## Current Plan

The current focus is on building the front-end of the chatbot application. The following steps are planned:

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Install necessary dependencies: `react-router-dom`, `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and `@mui/icons-material`.
    *   Create a basic project structure with `pages` and `components` directories.

2.  **Component Creation:**
    *   `ChatPage.tsx`: The main page for the chat application.
    *   `Message.tsx`: A component to render individual chat messages.
    *   `UserInput.tsx`: A component for the user's text input and send button.

3.  **Styling and Layout:**
    *   Create a `theme.ts` file to define a custom Material-UI theme.
    *   Style the `ChatPage` to have a clean and modern layout.
    *   Style the `Message` and `UserInput` components to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

4.  **Routing:**
    *   Set up `react-router-dom` in `App.tsx` to render the `ChatPage` as the main page.

5.  **State Management:**
    *   Use the `useState` hook in `ChatPage.tsx` to manage the conversation history.
    *   Create a mock conversation to display in the chat interface.

6.  **Next Steps:**
    *   Integrate with a cloud database (e.g., Firebase) to store and retrieve chat data.
    *   Connect to an LLM API (e.g., Gemini) to generate AI responses.
    *   Implement user authentication.
